質問 3
Assume we use RNA-Seq to get 1,000 reads that are mapped back to a gene with a length of 10,000 bp. If the total number of reads mapped back to the genome is 10,000,000, then what is the expression level (in RPKM) of this gene?
通过RNA-Seq测得回帖到某基因上的序列共1,000条，该基因长度为10,000bp， 且回帖到整个基因组的序列共10,000,000条，则该基因的表达量用RPKM衡量应该是多少？

- 1,000
- 100
- 10   vvvvvv
- 1


質問 4
Let's sequence the human transcriptome. Assume that the total number of reads mapped back to the genome is 10,000,000, among which 20,000 are mapped to gene A and 40,000 are mapped to gene B. If gene A has a length of 1,000 bp and gene B has a length of 3,000 bp, then whose expression level is higher?
对人的转录组进行测序，回帖到基因组上的序列一共有10,000,000条，其中位于基因A上的序列有20,000条，位于基因B上的序列有40,000条，基因A的长度为1,000bp, 基因B的长度为3,000bp，则A与B的表达量哪一个更高？

- It cannot be determined. 无法确定
- The expression level of A is higher. A的表达量更高   vvvvvv
- A and B have the same expression level. A和B的表达量相同
- The expression level of B is higher. B的表达量更高
